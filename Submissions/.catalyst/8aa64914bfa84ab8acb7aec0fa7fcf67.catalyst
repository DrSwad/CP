However, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">for all $$$n$$$ in the test cases of this problem, it&apos;s guaranteed that it&apos;s possible to delete some of their digits to obtain a not prime number</span>.</p><p>Note that you cannot remove all the digits from the number.</p><p>A prime number is a number that has no divisors except one and itself. A composite is a number that has more than two divisors. $$$1$$$ is neither a prime nor a composite number.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.</p><p>The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$), denoting the number of test cases.
