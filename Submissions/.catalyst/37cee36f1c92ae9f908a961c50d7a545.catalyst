In one of his favorite games, the player character is in a universe where every planet is designated by a binary number from $$$0$$$ to $$$2^n - 1$$$. On each planet, there are gates that allow the player to move from planet $$$i$$$ to planet $$$j$$$ if the binary representations of $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ differ in exactly one bit.</p><p>William wants to test you and see how you can handle processing the following queries in this game universe:</p><ul> <li> Destroy planets with numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusively. These planets cannot be moved to anymore.</li><li> Figure out if it is possible to reach planet $$$b$$$ from planet $$$a$$$ using some number of planetary gates. It is guaranteed that the planets $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ are not destroyed. </li></ul>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$, $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$), which are the number of bits in binary representation of each planets&apos; designation and the number of queries, respectively.</p><p>Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains a query of two types:</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">block l r</span>&#xA0;&#x2014; query for destruction of planets with numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusively ($$$0 \\le l \\le r &lt; 2^n$$$).
