In $$$1$$$ move, you can do one of the following actions:</p><ul> <li> erase any digit of the number (it&apos;s acceptable that the number before the operation has exactly one digit and after the operation, it is &quot;empty&quot;); </li><li> add one digit <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">to the right</span>. </li></ul><p>The actions may be performed in any order any number of times.</p><p>Note that if, after deleting some digit from a number, it will contain leading zeroes, they will <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">not</span> be deleted. E.g. if you delete from the number $$$301$$$ the digit $$$3$$$, the result is the number $$$01$$$ (not $$$1$$$).</p><p>You need to perform the <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">minimum</span> number of actions to make the number any power of $$$2$$$ (i.e. there&apos;s an integer $$$k$$$ ($$$k \\ge 0$$$) such that the resulting number is equal to $$$2^k$$$). <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">The resulting number must not have leading zeroes</span>.</p><p>E.g. consider $$$n=1052$$$. The answer is equal to $$$2$$$. First, let&apos;s add to the right one digit $$$4$$$ (the result will be $$$10524$$$). Then let&apos;s erase the digit $$$5$$$, so the result will be $$$1024$$$ which is a power of $$$2$$$.</p><p>E.g. consider $$$n=8888$$$. The answer is equal to $$$3$$$. Let&apos;s erase any of the digits $$$8$$$ three times. The result will be $$$8$$$ which is a power of $$$2$$$.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) &#x2014; the number of test cases.
