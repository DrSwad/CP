Some armchairs are occupied by people (at most one person per armchair), others are not. The number of occupied armchairs is not greater than $$$\\frac{n}{2}$$$.</p><p>For some reason, you would like to tell people to move from their armchairs to some other ones. If the $$$i$$$-th armchair is occupied by someone and the $$$j$$$-th armchair is not, you can tell the person sitting in the $$$i$$$-th armchair to move to the $$$j$$$-th armchair. The time it takes a person to move from the $$$i$$$-th armchair to the $$$j$$$-th one is $$$|i - j|$$$ minutes. You may perform this operation any number of times, but these operations must be done sequentially, i. e. you cannot tell a person to move until the person you asked to move in the last operation has finished moving to their destination armchair.</p><p>You want to achieve the following situation: every seat that was initially occupied must be free.
