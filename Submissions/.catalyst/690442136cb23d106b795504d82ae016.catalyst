Each tunnel connects two distinct caves. Any two caves are connected with at most one tunnel. Any cave can be reached from any other cave by moving via tunnels.</p><p>The hero starts the level in cave $$$1$$$, and every other cave contains a monster.</p><p>The hero can move between caves via tunnels. If the hero leaves a cave and enters a tunnel, he must finish his movement and arrive at the opposite end of the tunnel.</p><p>The hero can use each tunnel to move in both directions. However, the hero <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">can not</span> use the same tunnel <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">twice in a row</span>. Formally, if the hero has just moved from cave $$$i$$$ to cave $$$j$$$ via a tunnel, he can not head back to cave $$$i$$$ immediately after, but he can head to any other cave connected to cave $$$j$$$ with a tunnel.</p><p>It is known that at least two tunnels come out of every cave, thus, the hero will never find himself in a dead end even considering the above requirement.</p><p>To pass the level, the hero must beat the monsters in all the caves. When the hero enters a cave for the first time, he will have to fight the monster in it. The hero can beat the monster in cave $$$i$$$ if and only if the hero&apos;s power is strictly greater than $$$a_i$$$. In case of beating the monster, the hero&apos;s power increases by $$$b_i$$$. If the hero can&apos;t beat the monster he&apos;s fighting, the game ends and the player loses.</p><p>After the hero beats the monster in cave $$$i$$$, all subsequent visits to cave $$$i$$$ won&apos;t have any consequences: the cave won&apos;t have any monsters, and the hero&apos;s power won&apos;t change either.</p><p>Find the smallest possible power the hero must start the level with to be able to beat all the monsters and pass the level.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.
