She has learned so much interesting knowledge from her teachers, especially her math teacher. Recently, Mocha is learning about binary system and very interested in bitwise operation.</p><p>This day, Mocha got a sequence $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$. In each operation, she can select an arbitrary interval $$$[l, r]$$$ and for all values $$$i$$$ ($$$0\\leq i \\leq r-l$$$), replace $$$a_{l+i}$$$ with $$$a_{l+i} \\,\\&amp;\\, a_{r-i}$$$ at the same time, where $$$\\&amp;$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND\">bitwise AND operation</a>. This operation can be performed <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any number of times</span>.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=5$$$, the array is $$$[a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5]$$$, and Mocha selects the interval $$$[2,5]$$$, then the new array is $$$[a_1,a_2\\,\\&amp;\\, a_5, a_3\\,\\&amp;\\, a_4, a_4\\,\\&amp;\\, a_3, a_5\\,\\&amp;\\, a_2]$$$.</p><p>Now Mocha wants to minimize the maximum value in the sequence.
