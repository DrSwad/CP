{"title":"E. Petr and Permutations","contestId":"987","contestName":"Codeforces Round #485 (Div. 2)","problemIndex":"E","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Petr likes to come up with problems about randomly generated data. This time problem is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random permutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and then $$$3n$$$ times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation just like Petr but swaps elements $$$7n+1$$$ times instead of $$$3n$$$ times. Because it is more random, OK?!</p><p>You somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from which one.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>In the first line of input there is one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$10^{3} \\le n \\le 10^{6}$$$).</p><p>In the second line there are $$$n$$$ distinct integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$&nbsp;— the permutation of size $$$n$$$ from the test.</p><p>It is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we choose $$$n$$$&nbsp;— the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method to generate a permutation&nbsp;— the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate a permutation using chosen method.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>If the test is generated via Petr's method print \"<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">Petr</span>\" (without quotes).
