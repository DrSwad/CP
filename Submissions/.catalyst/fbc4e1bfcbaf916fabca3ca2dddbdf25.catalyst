In this game he manages a great empire: builds cities and conquers new lands.</p><p>Monocarp's empire has $$$n$$$ cities. In order to conquer new lands he plans to build <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">one Monument in each city</span>. The game is turn-based and, since Monocarp is still amateur, he builds exactly one Monument per turn.</p><p>Monocarp has $$$m$$$ points on the map he'd like to control using the constructed Monuments. For each point he knows the distance between it and each city. Monuments work in the following way: when built in some city, a Monument controls all points at distance at most $$$1$$$ to this city. Next turn, the Monument controls all points at distance at most $$$2$$$, the turn after&nbsp;— at distance at most $$$3$$$, and so on. Monocarp will build $$$n$$$ Monuments in $$$n$$$ turns and his empire will conquer all points that are controlled by at least one Monument.</p><p>Monocarp can't figure out any strategy, so during each turn he will choose a city for a Monument randomly among all remaining cities (cities without Monuments). Monocarp wants to know how many points (among $$$m$$$ of them) he will conquer at the end of turn number $$$n$$$. Help him to calculate the expected number of conquered points!</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 20$$$; $$$1 \\le m \\le 5 \\cdot 10^4$$$)&nbsp;— the number of cities and the number of points.</p><p>Next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$m$$$ integers each: the $$$j$$$-th integer of the $$$i$$$-th line $$$d_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \\le d_{i, j} \\le n + 1$$$) is the distance between the $$$i$$$-th city and the $$$j$$$-th point.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>It can be shown that the expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the $$$n$$$-th turn can be represented as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$.
