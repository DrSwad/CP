Subset Trick","contestId":"1500","contestName":"Codeforces Round #707 (Div. 1, based on Moscow Open Olympiad in Informatics)","problemIndex":"E","timeLimit":"3 seconds","memLimit":"512 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Vanya invented an interesting trick with a set of integers.</p><p>Let an illusionist have a set of positive integers $$$S$$$. He names a positive integer $$$x$$$. Then an audience volunteer must choose some subset (possibly, empty) of $$$S$$$ without disclosing it to the illusionist. The volunteer tells the illusionist the size of the chosen subset. And here comes the trick: the illusionist guesses whether the sum of the subset elements does not exceed $$$x$$$. The sum of elements of an empty subset is considered to be $$$0$$$.</p><p>Vanya wants to prepare the trick for a public performance. He prepared some set of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> positive integers $$$S$$$. Vasya wants the trick to be successful. He calls a positive number $$$x$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-it\">unsuitable</span>, if he can't be sure that the trick would be successful for every subset a viewer can choose.</p><p>Vanya wants to count the number of unsuitable integers for the chosen set $$$S$$$.</p><p>Vanya plans to try different sets $$$S$$$. He wants you to write a program that finds the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set $$$S$$$, and after each change to the set $$$S$$$. Vanya will make $$$q$$$ changes to the set, and each change is one of the following two types: </p><ul> <li> add a new integer $$$a$$$ to the set $$$S$$$, or </li><li> remove some integer $$$a$$$ from the set $$$S$$$. </li></ul>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, q \\leq 200\\,000$$$)&nbsp;— the size of the initial set $$$S$$$ and the number of changes.</p><p>The next line contains $$$n$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">distinct</span> integers $$$s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i \\leq 10^{13}$$$)&nbsp;— the initial elements of $$$S$$$.</p><p>Each of the following $$$q$$$ lines contain two integers $$$t_i$$$, $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t_i \\leq 2$$$, $$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{13}$$$), describing a change: </p><ul> <li> If $$$t_i = 1$$$, then an integer $$$a_i$$$ is added to the set $$$S$$$. It is guaranteed that this integer is not present in $$$S$$$ before this operation. </li><li> If $$$t_i = 2$$$, then an integer $$$a_i$$$ is removed from the set $$$S$$$. In is guaranteed that this integer is present in $$$S$$$ before this operation. </li></ul>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print $$$q + 1$$$ lines.</p><p>In the first line print the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set $$$S$$$. In the next $$$q$$$ lines print the number of unsuitable integers for $$$S$$$ after each change.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example the initial set is $$$S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$$$. For this set the trick can be unsuccessful for $$$x \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$$. For example, if $$$x = 4$$$, the volunteer can choose the subset $$$\\{1, 2\\}$$$ with sum $$$3 \\leq x$$$, and can choose the subset $$$\\{2, 3\\}$$$ with sum $$$5 &gt; x$$$. However, in both cases the illusionist only know the same size of the subset ($$$2$$$), so he can't be sure answering making a guess. Since there is only one subset of size $$$3$$$, and the sum of each subset of smaller size does not exceed $$$5$$$, all $$$x \\ge 5$$$ are suitable.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1615629407802,"input":"3 11\n1 2 3\n2 1\n1 5\n1 6\n1 7\n2 6\n2 2\n2 3\n1 10\n2 5\n2 7\n2 10\n","output":"4\n1\n6\n12\n19\n13\n8\n2\n10\n3\n0\n0\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1500/submit","language":"c++"}
