He has $$$n$$$ cubes arranged in a row, with numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ written on them. He'll make <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly</span> $$$j$$$ operations. In each operation, he'll pick up $$$2$$$ cubes and switch their positions.</p><p>He's wondering: how many different sequences of cubes can I have at the end?
