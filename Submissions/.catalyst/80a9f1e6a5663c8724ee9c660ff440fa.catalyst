The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of weights of all the edges included in a spanning tree.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq min(n - 1, 5)$$$).</p><p>The second line contains $$$k$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq d_i \\leq n$$$). </p><p>The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n - 1$$$ lines contains $$$n - i$$$ integers $$$w_{i,i+1}, w_{i,i+2}, \\ldots, w_{i,n}$$$ ($$$1 \\leq w_{i,j} \\leq 100$$$): weights of edges $$$(i,i+1),(i,i+2),\\ldots,(i,n)$$$.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print one integer: the minimum weight of a spanning tree under given degree constraints for the first $$$k$$$ vertices. </p>","noteHtml":null,"sampleTestcases":[{"id":1630252535421,"input":"10 5\n5 3 4 2 1\n29 49 33 12 55 15 32 62 37\n61 26 15 58 15 22 8 58\n37 16 9 39 20 14 58\n10 15 40 3 19 55\n53 13 37 44 52\n23 59 58 4\n69 80 29\n89 28\n48\n","output":"95\n"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1556/submit","language":"c++","isPartOfContest":true}
