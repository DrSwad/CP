{"title":"F. Tubular Bells","contestId":"1562","problemIndex":"F","timeLimit":"5 seconds","memLimit":"512 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Do you know what tubular bells are? They are a musical instrument made up of cylindrical metal tubes. In an orchestra, tubular bells are used to mimic the ringing of bells.</p><p>Mike has tubular bells, too! They consist of $$$n$$$ tubes, and each of the tubes has a length that can be expressed by a integer from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive. It is clear that the lengths of all the tubes are different (it makes no sense to make the same tubes). It is also known that $$$r-l+1 = n$$$.</p><p>Formally, we can say that Mike&apos;s tubular bells are described by a permutation $$$a$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that contains all numbers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ inclusive, with $$$a_i$$$ denoting the length of the $$$i$$$-th tube.</p><p>You are offered an interesting task: to guess what Mike&apos;s instrument looks like. Simply, you must guess the permutation.</p><p>Mike won&apos;t tell you $$$l$$$ or $$$r$$$. He will only tell you $$$n$$$, and will allow you to ask no more than $$$n + 5000$$$ queries.</p><p>In each query, you name two positive integers $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$ such that $$$1 \\le x, y \\le n, x \\neq y$$$. In response to this query, the program written by Mike will give you $$$\\mathrm{lcm}(a_x, a_y)$$$, where $$$\\mathrm{lcm}(c,d)$$$ denotes the least common multiple of $$$c$$$ and $$$d$$$.</p><p>Solve Mike&apos;s problem!</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.</p><p>The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20$$$), denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The single line of each test case contains one positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; number of tubes in Mike&apos;s tubular bells. Also $$$1 \\le l \\le r \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, i.e. the lengths of the tubes do not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">maximal number of queries</span> (i.e. $$$n + 5000$$$) over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5 + 5000$$$. It means that sum of $$$n$$$ does not exceed $$$10^5 + 5000 - t \\cdot 5000$$$.</p>","outSpecsHtml":null,"noteHtml":null,"sampleTestcases":[{"id":1631008567308,"input":"3\n5\n8 10 7 6 9\n5\n24 25 28 27 26\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n","output":"? 1 2\n40\n? 2 5\n90\n? 3 1\n56\n? 4 5\n18\n! 8 10 7 6 9\n? 1 5\n312\n? 2 4\n675\n! 24 25 28 27 26\n? 1 4\n4\n? 2 5\n10\n? 3 7\n21\n? 6 2\n6\n? 2 5\n10\n? 1 2\n2\n? 1 2\n2\n? 1 2\n2\n? 1 2\n2\n? 1 2\n2\n! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7"}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1562/submit","language":"c++","isPartOfContest":true}
