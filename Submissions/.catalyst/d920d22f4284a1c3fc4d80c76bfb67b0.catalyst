All of the cells grow a sunflower on it. Unfortunately, one night, the lightning stroke some (possibly zero) cells, and sunflowers on those cells were burned into ashes. In other words, those cells struck by the lightning became empty. Magically, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">any two empty cells have no common points</span> (neither edges nor corners).</p><p>Now the owner wants to remove some (possibly zero) sunflowers to reach the following two goals: </p><ul>  <li> When you are on an empty cell, you can walk to any other empty cell. In other words, those empty cells are connected.  </li><li> There is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">exactly one</span> simple path between any two empty cells. In other words, there is no cycle among the empty cells. </li></ul><p>You can walk from an empty cell to another if they share a common edge.</p><p>Could you please give the owner a solution that meets all her requirements?</p><p>Note that you are not allowed to plant sunflowers.
