Arkady starts listening to the songs in the playlist one by one, starting from song $$$1$$$. The playlist is cycled, i.&nbsp;e. after listening to the last song, Arkady will continue listening from the beginning.</p><p>Each song has a genre $$$a_i$$$, which is a positive integer. Let Arkady finish listening to a song with genre $$$y$$$, and the genre of the next-to-last listened song be $$$x$$$. If $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y) = 1$$$, he deletes the last listened song (with genre $$$y$$$) from the playlist. After that he continues listening normally, skipping the deleted songs, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">forgetting</span> about songs he listened to before. In other words, after he deletes a song, he can't delete the next song immediately.</p><p>Here $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)$$$ denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor\">greatest common divisor (GCD)</a> of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.</p><p>For example, if the initial songs' genres were $$$[5, 9, 2, 10, 15]$$$, then the playlist is converted as follows: [<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">5</span>, 9, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">5</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">9</span>, 2, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, 10, 15] (because $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(5, 9) = 1$$$) $$$\\to$$$ [5, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">2</span>, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">2</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">10</span>, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 2, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">10</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">15</span>] $$$\\to$$$ [<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">5</span>, 2, 10, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">15</span>] $$$\\to$$$ [<span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">5</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">2</span>, 10, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, 10, 15] (because $$$\\operatorname{gcd}(5, 2) = 1$$$) $$$\\to$$$ [5, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">10</span>, 15] $$$\\to$$$ [5, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">10</span>, <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">15</span>] $$$\\to$$$ ... The bold numbers represent the two last played songs.
