Christmas Game","contestId":"1498","contestName":"CodeCraft-21 and Codeforces Round #711 (Div. 2)","problemIndex":"F","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Alice and Bob are going to celebrate Christmas by playing a game with a tree of presents. The tree has $$$n$$$ nodes (numbered $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, with some node $$$r$$$ as its root). There are $$$a_i$$$ presents are hanging from the $$$i$$$-th node.</p><p>Before beginning the game, a special integer $$$k$$$ is chosen. The game proceeds as follows:</p><ul><li> Alice begins the game, with moves alternating each turn;</li><li> in any move, the current player may choose some node (for example, $$$i$$$) which has depth at least $$$k$$$. Then, the player picks some positive number of presents hanging from that node, let's call it $$$m$$$ $$$(1 \\le m \\le a_i)$$$;</li><li> the player then places these $$$m$$$ presents on the $$$k$$$-th ancestor (let's call it $$$j$$$) of the $$$i$$$-th node (the $$$k$$$-th ancestor of vertex $$$i$$$ is a vertex $$$j$$$ such that $$$i$$$ is a descendant of $$$j$$$, and the difference between the depth of $$$j$$$ and the depth of $$$i$$$ is exactly $$$k$$$). Now, the number of presents of the $$$i$$$-th node $$$(a_i)$$$ is decreased by $$$m$$$, and, correspondingly, $$$a_j$$$ is increased by $$$m$$$;</li><li> Alice and Bob both play optimally. The player unable to make a move loses the game.</li></ul><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">For each possible root</span> of the tree, find who among Alice or Bob wins the game.</p><p>Note: The depth of a node $$$i$$$ in a tree with root $$$r$$$ is defined as the number of edges on the simple path from node $$$r$$$ to node $$$i$$$. The depth of root $$$r$$$ itself is zero.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two space-separated integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ $$$(3 \\le n \\le 10^5, 1 \\le k \\le 20)$$$.</p><p>The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ $$$(1 \\le x, y \\le n, x \\neq y)$$$, denoting an undirected edge between the two nodes $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.
